# Instructions

The scripts were developed so that all relevant analyses results can be obtained by running one single script.
No processing overhead is expected if any script is not used in the final analysis report when the routine is run.

## First time

Install dependencies with:

1. Run `scripts/install_deps.R`

## Run the analysis

After all packages are installed, you can:

1. Run `scripts/results.R` to create all tables and plots into memory;
2. Run `scripts/plots-save.R` to save all figures in `figures/`
